# Serpent-s-Trial---First-semester-project
Serpent's Trial is a Greek mythology-inspired puzzle game. As Medusa's descendant, petrify enemies into movable statues within Athena’s temple.
Use lasers, mirrors, and strategic thinking to solve puzzles across 12 challenging designed levels.

Serpent's Trial was developed as a student project at the [S4G School for Games](https://www.school4games.net/) between January and March 2025.
Play it on [Itch.io!](https://s4g.itch.io/serpents-trial)

## Responsibilities

My main focus in this project was the implementation of all 
[puzzle mechanics](https://github.com/AnubisDev161/Serpent-s-Trial---first-semester-project/tree/main/Scripts/Interactables), while my co-programmer was responsible for the player and enemies. 
I was also responsible for the [main mechanic](https://github.com/AnubisDev161/Serpent-s-Trial---first-semester-project/blob/main/Scripts/Character/Player/Player_laser.gd) and implemented big parts of the [UI](https://github.com/AnubisDev161/Serpent-s-Trial---first-semester-project/tree/main/Scripts/UI/Menus) and the [sound system](https://github.com/AnubisDev161/Serpent-s-Trial---first-semester-project/blob/main/Scripts/Sound/Music_and_sound_manager.gd).


## About the project 

The game was developed using the Godot game engine.
The programming language was GdScript, which is similar to Python.
